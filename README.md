# Finance Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict loan approval based on applicant data such as income, education, employment status, and credit history. Three machine learning models were used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing consists of various features that affect loan approval decisions. The dataset includes:
- Applicant income
- Coapplicant income
- Loan amount
- Loan term
- Credit history
- Demographic features

## Model Performance
After training and evaluating the models, the following accuracy rates were achieved:
- Logistic Regression: 78.9%
- Random Forest: 77.3%
- Gradient Boosting: 76.2%
